    "Food insecurity is a huge problem for the United States. More than 1 in 7 families experienced food insecurity at some point in 2012 (Hunger in America). Children who facing hunger are more likely to struggle in school, experience developmental impairments, and have more social and behavior problems (Feeding America). Some studies have also shown that child food insecurity and paradoxically lead to child obesity (Olson). However, there are many resources available to help combat food insecurities. There are food banks, meal programs, and grocery programs. For children specifically, there are school breakfast, lunch, and snack programs in place across the country."

    "Data sources: ERS estimates using 3 years of data from the Current Population Survey Food Security Supplement, as reported in Table 5 in the referenced report, Household Food Security in the United States in 2015 (September 2016). The food security survey asks one adult respondent in each household a series of questions about experiences and behaviors that indicate food insecurity. The food security status of the household was assessed based on the number of food-insecure conditions reported (such as being unable to afford balanced meals, cutting the size of meals because of too little money for food, or being hungry because of too little money for food). Note: margins of error are substantial for some States; comparisons between States should take into consideration margins of error published in the source report."
